| Improvement of Frequency Standards with Quantum Entanglement, A. Ekert, J. Cirac, et al      | 1997/06       | In noiseless case, this paper finds the minimum frequency estimation uncertainty of a ramsey experiment of n qubits in a product state to be $\delta\omega = \frac{1}{\sqrt{nTt}}$, where T is total experiment time, and t is the ramsey wait time. For n GHZ entangled qubits, this becomes $\delta\omega = \frac{1}{n\sqrt{Tt}}$, which is a $\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}$ improvement. They then calculate the effect of uncorrelated dephasing noise, and find that there is then a different optimal ramsey wait time for a product and entangled ramsey experiment related to the dephasing time of the noise. For both cases, if you operate at the optimum ramsey wait time, **you end up with the same frequency uncertainty**. This shows that there is no advantage of GHZ entangled states for uncorrelated dephasing noise.     |
